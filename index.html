      <div class="introduction">
        <p>Hello Visitor!</p>

        <p>
          I am an incoming UCLA transfer student pursuing a degree in Mathematics of Computation
          (think Math with a good bit of Stats and CS mixed in). Though I am not on campus yet,
          I plan to be active during the school year by joining clubs such as ACM (Association of
          Computing Machinery) and Bruin Entrepreneurs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am interested in positions that would allow me to integrate both my strong technical
          and creativity skills. I love working on products that are not only useful, but
          intuitively designed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, you can probably find me catching up on the NBA and NFL, on my quest
          to find the best coffee shop in San Francisco, or entertaining the idea that we may be
          living in a computer simulation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please feel free to contact me. I am open to discussing a wide variety of topics, from
          my qualifications to the upcoming NFL season!
        </p>

              My main task was to look into potential ways to reduce the cost of storing
              large amounts of data on AWS (Amazon Web Services). To do this, I used various
              Python packages, such as numPy and pandas, to create a script that collected
              data about our storage costs from AWS. Then, I created a summary, which included
              graphs and tables, that clearly illustrated how the money was being allocated.

              I collaborated with a partner to create a Tic-Tac-Toe web application that is
              currently hosted on Heroku. Upon arriving on the website, users have the option
              to either play with a local friend or against a computer. I primarily worked on
              the back-end. More notably, in an attempt to make the computer option more
              challenging, I implemented an algorithm that allowed the computer to have a
              winning strategy. For example, the computer is able to recognize when the user is
              only one move away from a win and as a result, will block the user from winning.

              divide the total cost between the number of people entered.

              As an NBA fan, I was interested to see how the moves this off-season would
              affect teams around the league. With the help of an NBA API, I created a
              script that collected the 2018-2019 stats of every player on each teams'
              projected starting five. Using the official NBA fantasy basketball style
              scoring system, I proceeded to calculate the fantasy points of each team
              in an attempt to predict their success this upcoming season. Then, the
              results were graphed using Matplotlib, as shown above.
